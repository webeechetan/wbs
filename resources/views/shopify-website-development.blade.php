                <p>  Shopify is a platform that can aid you 
                    in selling products by helping you set up online stores for your business. It’s a platform with all 
                    the e-commerce and point of sale features you need to start, run, and grow your business.

                <p> With it, you can sell anytime and anywhere. One single dashboard helps you manage orders,
                     shipping, and payments anywhere you go. Since its commencement, it has empowered over 
                     10,00,000 businesses in 175 countries and has helped them make over $200 billion USD.

                <p> With the fast pace at which the world is changing and moving, 
                    it is important to keep up and to make sure that people know of your brand and 
                    what it stands for. At the end of the day, business boils down to crunching numbers 
                    and selling whatever you sell in the best way possible.

                     all of this will help you grow as a business and explore prospects that you didn’t even know existed.
