                <p>  Let’s get one thing straight – we aren’t here to throw fancy terms at you and promise you something 
                     unattainable within a short period. Our overall approach to Search Engine Optimization and
                      Search Engine Marketing is straightforward – we believe in keeping it simple and transparent
                </p>
                <p> Content truly is king and if marketed in the right way, it can get your brand and 
                    business the traction it deserves. Along with text and static images, videos and GIFs
                     have now become the most popular content formats. Algorithms of search engines like Google 
                     tend to reward pages with features like social media integration, social bookmarking, 
                     and rich videos. Extensive studies done on digital user behaviour and content 
                     consumption also point towards videos and GIFs being the most attractive and 
                     attention-sustaining form of content.
                </p>
                <p>  Thus, leveraging videos and GIFs is a fantastic way to capture your audience and build 
                    a prominent and distinctive tone of communication for your brand. WeBeeSocial, a Delhi-based digital
                     marketing agency, has an in-house team dedicated to creating a unique and exciting range of online
