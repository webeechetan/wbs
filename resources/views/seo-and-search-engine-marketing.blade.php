                <p>  Let’s get one thing straight – we aren’t here to throw fancy terms at you and promise you something 
                     unattainable within a short period. Our overall approach to Search Engine Optimization and
                      Search Engine Marketing is straightforward – we believe in keeping it simple and transparent

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>  Here’s a quick overview of the way we work. We begin by auditing your assets and assessing 
                     your SEO/SEM goals post which we share timeline expectations. We then plan a campaign in detail,
                     review your analytics and your competitors, assess your keyword potential and compile a database of
                     link opportunities. Once you’ve given us the green signal, we move forward with our plan of action.
                     First, we take care of your on-page optimization, making your site visible to search engine spiders. 
                     This helps ensure that search engines know you’re a worthy candidate when 
                     someone’s looking up a keyword and helps push you to the top for greater visibility
                </p>
                <p>  Then, we take care of your off-page optimization. This is done through high-quality articles
                     and content, infographics for link-baiting, social backlinking, natural link building and 
                     social media management for SEO impact. All of this is covered in our monthly package, so rest
                     assured that you’re getting the best of all that we have to offer. Finally, we provide our clients' 
                     detailed monthly reports and hold regular review meetings. Hindsight is always 20/20, and it truly
                     is the key to a successful working relationship. 
                     We see the good, the bad, and the ugly, and refresh our plan of action periodically.

                <p>  So, without further ado, let’s have a look at how we managed to bring home a Bronze from the Agency 
                     Reporter's Front Benchers 2021! To be honest, it was not an easy task - we couldn’t
                      have achieved this without our highly creative and specialised team.
                </p>
                <p>  Tanziif LLC was seeking to achieve good SEO rankings for their website but was not 
                     getting the desired results. So, they decided to contact us regarding their concern,
                     and we were more than happy to help. For Tanziif LLC our goal was to achieve Top 10 
                     rankings on Google for 20 keywords and indeed we managed to achieve that in no time. 
                     Paid articles and online PR regularly also helped us boost our backlinking score and 
                     optimize the off-page results further. For more information, you can also check out
                      the case study for our client here. (We can add a link to our case study).
